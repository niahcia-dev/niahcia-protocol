# NIAHCIA Chain State V1

## Status

Draft storage/validation model.

NIAHCIA maintains its own consensus chain database independently of the execution engine database.

## Minimum stored header metadata

For every known valid or provisionally valid block:

- block ID
- canonical BlockHeaderV1 bytes
- parent block ID
- height
- timestamp
- target
- per-block work
- cumulative work
- transactions root
- execution root
- canonical/orphan status

## Fork choice

Among fully valid branches:

```text
preferred_chain = branch with greatest cumulative work
```

Block count alone does not determine fork choice.

## Validation stages

A candidate block is processed in this order:

1. decode exact BlockHeaderV1,
2. verify supported version,
3. verify parent exists (except genesis),
4. verify height,
5. verify timestamp rules,
6. verify expected target,
7. derive RandomX seed from NIAHCIA history,
8. verify RandomX PoW,
9. verify transaction Merkle root,
10. execute/verify execution result,
11. verify execution root,
12. calculate block work and cumulative work,
13. insert into block tree,
14. change canonical head only if fork-choice rules require it,
15. instruct the execution engine to follow the resulting NIAHCIA canonical head.

## Authority boundary

Reth's database is execution state.

The NIAHCIA chain database is the authority for:

- NIAHCIA parentage,
- PoW validity,
- cumulative work,
- canonical-chain selection,
- reorganization decisions.
