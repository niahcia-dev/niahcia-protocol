# Job

## Purpose

`Job` is the generic unit of requested work.

The schema MUST NOT assume text-only inference or one execution/verification mechanism.

## Canonical fields

```text
Job
- schema_version
- job_id
- requester
- agent_id
- agent_version
- model_id
- execution_profile_id
- workload_type
- input_manifest_hash
- output_requirements_hash
- verification_policy_id
- payment_plan_id
- resource_requirements
- privacy_requirements
- scheduling_policy
- parent_job_id
- root_job_id
- created_block
- deadline_block
- status
- accepted_result_id
```

## Workload types

Initial vocabulary:

```text
TEXT_INFERENCE
VISION_INFERENCE
AUDIO_INFERENCE
EMBEDDING
RERANKING
TOOL_EXECUTION
TRAINING
FINE_TUNING
MULTI_AGENT
CUSTOM
```

## Parent/child jobs

Agent-to-agent calls and compound workloads use:

- `parent_job_id` — immediate caller job
- `root_job_id` — top-level originating job

Budgets and recursion limits are enforced through policy objects rather than implicit conventions.

## Job state

User-facing lifecycle is intentionally compact:

```text
REQUESTED
EXECUTING
RESPONDED
SETTLED
```

Exceptional terminal/intermediate states include:

```text
FAILED
DISPUTED
EXPIRED
CANCELLED
```

Implementations MAY track more internal states for assignment, commit/reveal, auditing, or retries.

## Fast response rule

The job may reach `RESPONDED` before `SETTLED`.

Streaming output is a P2P data-plane operation. Blockchain settlement is asynchronous.

## Invariants

1. Large inputs/outputs MUST NOT be required on-chain.
2. The job MUST commit to exact input and execution requirements.
3. The accepted result MUST be bound to this `job_id`.
4. Payment and verification semantics are explicit through referenced policy objects.
5. Job deadlines are expressed in deterministic chain terms where on-chain enforcement is required.

## Prototype 0

Prototype 0 supports TEXT_INFERENCE with a pinned Agent/Model/ExecutionProfile and redundant verification.
